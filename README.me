# Overview

The project aims to develop an online platform that connects freelancers with clients seeking specialized services, facilitating direct and efficient interaction between both parties. The platform will allow clients to post their needs, while freelancers can view these requests, submit proposals, or list their own services for hire.

The development will utilize modern technologies, employing C# for the backend and Vue.js for the frontend, to create a robust foundation and a user-friendly interface. Initially, the focus will be on the web version, with plans to expand to mobile applications. The platform will start as a free service but will later include secure payment mechanisms to ensure reliable transactions.

With an innovative approach, the goal is to create a virtual environment that simplifies the negotiation of freelance services, benefiting both professionals and clients. The platform has the potential to become an essential resource in the market, promoting new job opportunities and facilitating access to specialized services.
